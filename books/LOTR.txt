Foreword 



This tale grew in the telling, until it became a history of the Great 
War of the Ring and included many glimpses of the yet more ancient history 
that preceded it. It was begun soon after The Hobbit was written and before 
its publication in 1937; but I did not go on with this sequel, for I wished 
first to complete and set in order the mythology and legends of the Elder 
Days, which had then been taking shape for some years. I desired to do this 
for my own satisfaction, and I had little hope that other people would be 
interested in this work, especially since it was primarily linguistic in 
inspiration and was begun in order to provide the necessary background of 
'history' for Elvish tongues.
